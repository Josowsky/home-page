      Currently you can find me in Poznan, Poland where I work as a Frontend
      Developer at NetGuru. Since beginning of my journey I helped to build
      multiple web applications for innovators and entrepreneurs from all over
      the world. Iâ€™ve had the pleasure to work with many talented people and
      great companies along the way.

      I enjoy web programming, learning new stuff and getting to know all the
      news from the JavaScript world. I believe that the best way to grow is by
      patience and consistency.
